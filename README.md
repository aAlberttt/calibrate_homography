# calibrate_homography

These are some multi-view camera geometry, camera calibration, however, they are the basic building blocks for 3D visual reconstruction systems. Here, I only used
DLT algorithm(normalized DLT). There are still some other algorithms to achieve such as Gold Standard or RANSAC.

I provided python code in .py and .ipynb view for calibration and homography.

The results of the code are generated by the pre-selected points and it can be changed after changing the selected points(check the commented code).
